Brainstorm Ideas
----------------
 - Tier0: route to location.
    1. Via external gmaps app
    2. Via in-app route trace
 - Tier1: Intelligent bookmarking by in-app photo and metadata guess/edit:
    food, recreation, fishing... Then grouping and querying.
 - Bookmark by in-app taking photo:
    * If no geotagging available (no inet) â€” prompt location by map.
 - Marker 'star':
    * If photos are overlapped in close zoom/location
 - Picker radius for location:
    * Draw circle on map to filter inside an area
 - Geotag:
    * By searching readable name and save back to gallery:
    * Tag: 'Jurmala' for these photos reflects its metadata in the gallery.
    * To find a way how to create new Images system collections out of my app.
    Like: Dirigent added, exported, in cloud sync, public etc.
 - Akavache & sync token
 - Switch map engine (and to know how much it cost):
    * Google
    * Apple
    * OSM
 - Upload photos to/like google maps social;
 - Also share image + place to twitter, fb;
 - Social components
    * Call uber to this place
    * Call police
    * You are walking near "paid place" notify or click/advertise
    * Call sharpei/dirigent/citizen for this place to walk with
    * Suggest other place near you ('flower', 'md briosh')
    * Cloud your bookmarks/photos
    * !!!The New Name For: U + Your Place + Destination + Photo
