Get Started

Firebase Storage lets you upload and share user generated content, such as images and video, which allows you to build rich media content into your apps.Firebase Storage stores this data in a[Google Cloud Storage][1] bucket, a petabyte scale object storage solution with high availability and global redundancy.Firebase Storage lets you securely upload these files directly from mobile devices and web browsers, handling spotty networks with ease.

Add Firebase to your app

1. Create a Firebase project in the[Firebase console][2], if you don't already have one. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, click Import Google Project. Otherwise, click Create New Project. 2. Click Add Firebase to your iOS app and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just[download the config file][3]. 3. When prompted, enter your app's bundle ID. It's important to enter the bundle ID your app is using; this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project. 4. At the end, you'll download a GoogleService-Info.plist file. You can [download this file][3] again at any time. 


Configure Storage in your app


Once you have your GoogleService-Info.plist file downloaded in your computer, do the following steps in Xamarin Studio: 

1. Add GoogleService-Info.plist file to your app project. 2. Set GoogleService-Info.plist build action behaviour to Bundle Resource by Right clicking/Build Action. 3. Add the following line of code somewhere in your app, typically in your AppDelegate's FinishedLaunching method (don't forget to import Firebase.Analytics namespace): 

App.Configure ();

Create a Storage Reference

Your files are stored in a Firebase Storage bucket.The files in this bucket are presented in a hierarchical structure, just like the file system on your local hard disk, or the data in the Firebase Realtime Database. By creating a reference to a file, your app gains access to it. These references can then be used to upload or download data, get or update metadata or delete the file. A reference can either point to a specific file or to a higher level in the hierarchy. 

Create a Reference

Create a reference to upload, download, or delete a file, or to get or update its metadata.A reference can be thought of as a pointer to a file in the cloud. References are lightweight, so you can create as many as you need. They are also reusable for multiple operations. 

References are created from the storage service on your Firebase app by calling the GetReferenceFromUrl method and passing in a URL of the form** gs://\<your-firebase-storage-bucket>**. You can find this URL in the Storage section of the [Firebase console][2]. 

// Get a reference to the storage service, using the default Firebase App
var storage = Storage.DefaultInstance;

// Create a storage reference from our storage service
StorageReference rootNode = storage.GetReferenceFromUrl("gs://<your-firebase-storage-bucket>")

// This is the same result as above
StorageReference rootNode = storage.GetRootReference();

You can create a reference to a location lower in the tree, say images/space.jpg, by using the GetChild method on an existing reference: 

// Create a child reference
// imagesNode now points to "images" ("gs://<your-firebase-storage-bucket>/images")
StorageReference imagesNode = rootNode.GetChild("images");

// Child references can also take paths delimited by '/'
// spaceNode now points to "images/space.jpg" ("gs://<your-firebase-storage-bucket>/images/space.jpg")
// imagesNode still points to "images"
StorageReference spaceNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/space.jpg");

// This is equivalent to creating the full reference
StorageReference spaceNode = storage.GetReferenceFromUrl("gs://<your-firebase-storage-bucket>/images/space.jpg");

Navigate with References

You can also use the Parent and Root properties to navigate up in our file hierarchy.Parent navigates up one level, while Root navigates all the way to the top.

// Parent allows us to move to the parent of a reference
// imagesNode now points to 'images'
StorageReference imagesNode = spaceNode.Parent;

// Root allows us to move all the way back to the top of our bucket
// rootNode now points to the root
StorageReference* rootNode = spaceNode.Parent;

GetChild method, Parent and Root properties can be chained together multiple times, as each returns a reference.The exception is the Parent of rootNode, which is null: 

// References can be chained together multiple times
// earthNode points to "images/earth.jpg"
StorageReference earthNode = spaceNode.Parent.GetChild("earth");

// nullNode is null, since the Parent of Root is null
StorageReference nullNode = spaceNode.Root.Parent;

Reference Properties

You can inspect references to better understand the files they point to using the FullPath, Name, and Bucket properties.These properties get the file's full path, name, and bucket: 

// Reference's path is: "images/space.jpg"
// This is analogous to a file path on disk
spaceNode.FullPath;

// Reference's name is the last segment of the full path: "space.jpg"
// This is analogous to the file name
spaceNode.Name;

// Reference's bucket is the name of the storage bucket where files are stored
spaceNode.Bucket;

Limitations on References

Reference paths and names can contain any sequence of valid Unicode characters, but certain restrictions are imposed including: 

1. Total length of reference.FullPath must be between 1 and 1024 bytes when UTF-8 encoded. 2. No Carriage Return or Line Feed characters. 3. Avoid using #, [, ], *, or ?, as these do not work well with other tools such as the Firebase Realtime Database or [gsutil][8]. 

Upload Files

Firebase Storage allows developers to quickly and easily upload files to a[Google Cloud Storage][1] bucket provided and managed by Firebase.

Note: By default, Firebase Storage buckets require Firebase Authentication to upload files.You can change your[Firebase Storage Security Rules][9]
to allow unauthenticated access.Since the default Google App Engine app and Firebase share this bucket, configuring public access may make newly uploaded App Engine files publicly accessible as well.Be sure to restrict access to your Storage bucket again when you set up authentication.

To upload a file, first create a Firebase Storage reference to the location in Firebase Storage you want to upload the file to.You cannot upload data with a reference to the root of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.Your reference must point to a child URL.

Once you have a reference, you can upload files to Firebase Storage in two ways: 

1. Upload from NSData in memory. 2. Upload from an NSUrl representing a file on device.

Upload from data in memory

The PutData method is the simplest way to upload a file to Firebase Storage. PutData takes an NSData object and returns a StorageUploadTask, which you can use to manage your upload and monitor its status: 

// Data in memory
NSData data = ...

// Create a reference to the file you want to upload
StorageReference riversNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/rivers.jpg");

// Upload the file to the path "images/rivers.jpg"
StorageUploadTask uploadTask = riversNode.PutData(data, null, (metadata, error) => {
	if (error != null) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// Metadata contains file metadata such as size, content-type, and download URL.
		NSUrl downloadUrl = metadata.DownloadUrl;
	}
});

Upload from a local file

You can upload local files on the devices, such as photos and videos from the camera, with the PutFile method.PutFile takes an NSUrl and returns a StorageUploadTask, which you can use to manage your upload and monitor its status: 

// Data in memory
NSUrl localFile = ...

// Create a reference to the file you want to upload
StorageReference riversNode = rootNode.GetChild ("images/rivers.jpg");

// Upload the file to the path "images/rivers.jpg"
StorageUploadTask uploadTask = riversNode.PutFile(localFile, null, (metadata, error) => {
	if (error != null) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// Metadata contains file metadata such as size, content-type, and download URL.
		NSUrl downloadUrl = metadata.DownloadUrl;
	}
});

If you want to actively manage your upload, you can use the PutData or PutFile methods and observe the upload task, rather than using the completion handler.See Manage Uploads and Downloads section below for more information. 

Add File Metadata

You can also include metadata when you upload files. This metadata contains typical file metadata properties such as Name, Size, and ContentType (commonly referred to as MIME type). The PutFile method automatically infers the content type from the NSUrl filename extension, but you can override the auto-detected type by specifying ContentType in the metadata.If you do not provide a ContentType and Firebase Storage cannot infer a default from the file extension, Firebase Storage uses application/octet-stream.See the Use File Metadata section below for more information about file metadata.

// Create storage reference
StorageReference mountainsNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/mountains.jpg");

// Create file metadata including the content type
var imageMetadata = new StorageMetadata {
	ContentType = "image/jpeg"
};

// Upload data and metadata
StorageUploadTask uploadTask = mountainsNode.PutData(data, metadata);

// Upload file and metadata
StorageUploadTask uploadTask = mountainsNode.PutFile(localFile, metadata);

Download Files

Firebase Storage allows developers to quickly and easily download files from a[Google Cloud Storage][1]
bucket provided and managed by Firebase.

Note: By default, Firebase Storage buckets require Firebase Authentication to upload files.You can change your [Firebase Storage Security Rules][9] to allow unauthenticated access. Since the default Google App Engine app and Firebase share this bucket, configuring public access may make newly uploaded App Engine files publicly accessible as well.Be sure to restrict access to your Storage bucket again when you set up authentication.

To download a file, first create a Firebase Storage reference to the file you want to download.

Once you have a reference, you can download files from Firebase Storage in three ways: 

1. Download to NSData in memory. 2. Download to an NSUrl representing a file on device. 3. Generate an NSUrl representing the file online.

Download in memory

Download the file to an NSData object in memory using the GetData method.This is the easiest way to quickly download a file, but it must load entire contents of your file into memory.If you request a file larger than your app's available memory, your app will crash. To protect against memory issues, make sure to set the max size to something you know your app can handle, or use another download method: 

// Create a reference to the file you want to download
StorageReference islandNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/island.jpg");

// Download in memory with a maximum allowed size of 1MB (1 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
islandNode.GetData (1 * 1024 * 1024, (data, error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	} else {
		// Data for "images/island.jpg" is returned
		var islandImage = UIImage.LoadFromData(data);
	}
});

Download to a local file

The WriteToFile method downloads a file directly to a local device.Use this if your users want to have access to the file while offline or to share in a different app.WriteToFile returns an StorageDownloadTask which you can use to manage your download and monitor the status of the upload: 

// Create a reference to the file you want to download
StorageReference islandNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/island.jpg");

// Create local filesystem Url
var localUrl = NSUrl.FromString("file:///local/images/island.jpg");

// Download to the local filesystem
StorageDownloadTask downloadTask = islandNode.WriteToFile(localUrl, (url, error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// Local file Url for "images/island.jpg" is returned
	}
});

If you want to actively manage your download, you can use the WriteToFile method and observe the download task, rather than use the completion handler.See Manage Uploads and Downloads section below for more information.

Generate a download Url

If you already have download infrastructure based around Urls, or just want a Url to share, you can get the download Url for a file by calling the GetDownloadUrl method on a storage reference: 

// Create a reference to the file you want to download
StorageReference starsNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/stars.jpg");

// Fetch the download Url
starsNode.GetDownloadUrl ((url, error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Handle any errors
	} else {
		// Get the download URL for 'images/stars.jpg'
	}
});

Manage Uploads and Downloads

In addition to starting uploads and downloads, you can pause, resume, and cancel uploads and downloads, using the Pause, Resume, and Cancel methods.These methods raise pause, resume, and cancel events that you can observe.Canceling an upload causes the upload to fail with an error indicating that the upload was canceled: 

// Start uploading/downloading a file
StorageUploadTask uploadTask = mountainsNode.PutFile(localFile, metadata);
StorageDownloadTask downloadTask = islandNode.WriteToFile(localUrl);

// Pause the upload/download
uploadTask.Pause ();
downloadTask.Pause ();

// Resume the upload/download
uploadTask.Resume ();
downloadTask.Resume ();

// Cancel the upload/download
uploadTask.Cancel ();
downloadTask.Cancel ();

Monitor Upload and Download Progress

You can attach observers to StorageUploadTask in order to monitor the progress of the upload.Adding an observer returns a string that can be used to remove the observer: 

// Add a progress observer to an upload task
string observer = uploadTask.ObserveStatus(StorageTaskStatus.Progress, (snapshot) => {
	// A progress event occurred
});

// Add a progress observer to a download task
string observer = downloadTask.ObserveStatus(StorageTaskStatus.Progress, (snapshot) => {
	// A progress event occurred
});

These observers can be added to an StorageTaskStatus event: 

| StorageTaskStatus Event        | Typical Usage | |:------------------------------:|---------------| | StorageTaskStatus.Resume   | This event fires when the task starts or resumes uploading/downloading, and is often used in conjunction with the StorageTaskStatus.Pause event. | | StorageTaskStatus.Progress | This event fires any time data is uploading/downloading to Firebase Storage, and can be used to populate an upload progress indicator. | | StorageTaskStatus.Pause    | This event fires any time the upload/download is paused, and is often used in conjunction with the StorageTaskStatus.Resume event. | | StorageTaskStatus.Success  | This event fires when a upload/download has completed sucessfully. | | StorageTaskStatus.Failure  | This event fires when a upload/download has failed. Inspect the error to determine the failure reason. | 

When an event occurs, an StorageTaskSnapshot object is passed back. This snapshot is an immutable view of the task, at the time the event occurred. This object contains the following properties/methods: 

| Name             | Kind         | Type                                           | Description | |:----------------:|:------------:|:----------------------------------------------:|-------------| | Progress     | Property | NSProgress                                 | An NSProgress object containing the progress of the upload/download. | | Error        | Property | NSError                                    | An error that occurred during upload/download, if any. | | Metadata     | Property | StorageMetadata                            | During upload contains metadata being uploaded. After an StorageTaskStatus.Success event, contains the uploaded file's metadata. null on downloads. | | GetTask<T> | Method   | StorageUploadTask/</br>StorageDownloadTask | The task this is a snapshot of, which can be used to manage (pause, resume, cancel) the task. | | Reference    | Property | StorageReference                           | The reference this task came from. | 

You can also remove observers, either individually, by status, or by removing all of them: 

// Create a task listener handle
string observer = ...

// Remove an individual observer
uploadTask.RemoveObserver(observer);
downloadTask.RemoveObserver(observer);

// Remove all observers of a particular status
uploadTask.RemoveAllObservers(StorageTaskStatus.Progress);
downloadTask.RemoveAllObservers(StorageTaskStatus.Progress);

// Remove all observers
uploadTask.RemoveAllObservers();
downloadTask.RemoveAllObservers();

To prevent memory leaks, all observers are removed after an StorageTaskStatus.Success or StorageTaskStatus.Failure occurs. 

Use File Metadata on iOS

After uploading a file to Firebase Storage reference, you can also get and update the file metadata, for example to update the content type.Files can also store custom key / value pairs with additional file metadata.

Get File Metadata

File metadata contains common properties such as Name, Size, and ContentType(often referred to as MIME type) in addition to some less common ones like ContentDisposition and TimeCreated.This metadata can be retrieved from a Firebase Storage reference using the GetMetadata method:

	// Create reference to the file whose metadata we want to retrieve
	StorageReference forestNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/forest.jpg");

// Get metadata properties
forestNode.GetMetadata((metadata, error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// Metadata now contains the metadata for 'images/forest.jpg'
	}
});

Update File Metadata

You can update file metadata at any time after the file upload completes by using the UpdateMetadata method.Refer to File Metadata Properties section below to see full list and for more information on what properties can be updated.Only the properties specified in the metadata are updated, all others are left unmodified.

// Create reference to the file whose metadata we want to change
StorageReference forestNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/forest.jpg");

// Create file metadata to update
var newMetadata = new StorageMetadata {
	CacheControl = "public,max-age=300",
	ContentType = "image/jpeg"
};

// Update metadata properties
forestNode.UpdateMetadata(newMetadata, (metadata, error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// Updated metadata for 'images/forest.jpg' is returned
	}
});

You can delete writable metadata properties by passing the empty string: 

// Create file metadata with property to delete
var newMetadata = new StorageMetadata {
	ContentType = "image/jpeg"
};

// Delete the metadata property
forestNode.UpdateMetadata(newMetadata, (metadata, error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// metadata.ContentType should be null
	}
});

Custom Metadata

You can specify custom metadata as an NSDictionary containing NSString properties: 

object[] keys = { "location", "activity" };
object[] values = { "Yosemite, CA, USA", "Hiking" };
var customMetadata = NSDictionary.FromObjectsAndKeys(values, keys, keys.Length);

var metadata = NSDictionary.FromObjectAndKey(customMetadata, new NSString("customMetadata"));

You can store app-specific data for each file in custom metadata, but Firebase highly recommend using a database (such as the[Firebase Database][10]) to store and synchronize this type of data.

File Metadata Properties

A full list of metadata properties on a file is available below:

| Property | Type | Writable | |:----------------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-------:| | Bucket | string | NO | | Generation | long | NO | | Metageneration | long | NO | | Path | string | NO | | Name | string | NO | | Size | long | NO | | TimeCreated | NSDate | NO | | Updated | NSDate | NO | | CacheControl | string | YES | | ContentDisposition | string | YES | | ContentEncoding | string | YES | | ContentLanguage | string | YES | | ContentType | string | YES | | DownloadUrls | NSUrl[] | NO | | CustomMetadata | NSDictionary<NSString, NSString> | YES |

Delete Files

Delete a File

To delete a file, first create a reference to that file. Then call the Delete method on that reference: 

// Create a reference to the file to delete
StorageReference desertNode = rootNode.GetChild("images/desert.jpg");

// Delete the file
desertNode.Delete((error) => {
	if (error != nil) {
		// Uh-oh, an error occurred!
	}
	else {
		// File deleted successfully
	}
});

Note: Deleting a file is a permenant action!If you care about restoring deleted files, make sure to back up your files, or[enable object versioning][11]
on your Google Cloud Storage bucket. 

Handle Errors

Sometimes when you're building an app, things don't go as planned and an error occurs. 

When in doubt, check the error returned, and see what the error message says. 

If you've checked the error message and have Storage Security Rules that allow your action, but are still struggling to fix the error, visit [Firebase Support page][12] and let them know how they can help. 

Handle Error Messages

There are a number of reasons why errors may occur, including the file not existing, the user not having permission to access the desired file, or the user cancelling the file upload. 

To properly diagnose the issue and handle the error, here is a full list of all the errors our client will raise, and how they can occur. 

| Name                                      | Reason | |:-----------------------------------------:|--------| | StorageErrorCode.Unknown              | An unknown error occurred. | | StorageErrorCode.ObjectNotFound       | No object exists at the desired reference. | | StorageErrorCode.BucketNotFound       | No bucket is configured for Firebase Storage. | | StorageErrorCode.ProjectNotFound      | No project is configured for Firebase Storage. | | StorageErrorCode.QuotaExceeded        | Quota on your Firebase Storage bucket has been exceeded. If you're on the free tier, upgrade to a paid plan. If you're on a paid plan, reach out to Firebase support. | StorageErrorCode.Unauthenticated      | User is unauthenticated. Authenticate and try again. | | StorageErrorCode.Unauthorized         | User is not authorized to perform the desired action. Check your rules to ensure they are correct. | | StorageErrorCode.RetryLimitExceeded   | The maximum time limit on an operation (upload, download, delete, etc.) has been exceeded. Try uploading again. | | StorageErrorCode.NonMatchingChecksum  | File on the client does not match the checksum of the file recieved by the server. Try uploading again. | | StorageErrorCode.Cancelled            | User cancelled the operation. | StorageErrorCode.DownloadSizeExceeded | Size of the downloaded file exceeds the amount of memory allocated for the download. Increase memory cap and try downloading again. |
